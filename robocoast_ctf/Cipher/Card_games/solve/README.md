You get this image with the flag in some weird symbols

![](../chal/1.png)

using google lens on the symbols the first hit is this reddit post with very similar looking symbols https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/nqwqhn/first_release_of_progress_engine_font/

The symbols are very similar but not quite the same. The first comment on the post gives us a google drive link that has a conversion table pdf for the symbols and the title of the pdf is `Proposed Phyrexian phonemes and orthography`

Googling the words `Phyrexian phonemes` will give us this wiki page https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Phyrexian_(language)

There is the symbol table and we got exact match for our symbols. Now we could convert them symbol by symbol. But if we scroll a little bit down on the page we find this

So we found the flag `xctf{All will be one}`
